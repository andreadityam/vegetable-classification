# Vegetable Classification Using CNNs

This project performs image classification on **15 types of vegetables** using three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures â€” **VGG16**, **MobileNetV2**, and **ResNet50**. The entire pipeline, including data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization, is implemented in a single Kaggle notebook.

## Models Used

Three popular CNN architectures were used via transfer learning:

- **VGG16**
- **MobileNetV2**
- **ResNet50**

All models were fine-tuned on the same dataset using a consistent training pipeline to compare performance.

## Evaluation & Visualization

Each model was evaluated using:

- Classification report  
- Confusion matrix  
- Accuracy and loss plots  
- Prediction visualization

---

## Libraries & Tools

- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
